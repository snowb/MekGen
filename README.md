# Mekton Mek Generator

This is a Vue/VueX based Mekton generator.
Intent to have a fairly simple interface for creating Mek components and systems.
As well as providing a simple means of savings and exporting/importing the created Mek or components. Eventually.

TODO

1. Update Build tab
    - Build tab will include building the actual Mek, as well being responsible for handling Linking and Splitting

2. Add Additive Systems
    - Probably under Build tab

3. Add Special Systems
    - Probably under Build tab

4. Add Cost Multipliers
    - Under Build tab

5. Add Scaling
    - Probably under Build tab or perhaps other tab
    - Or perhaps in Design under each individual component tab

6. Add Advanced Rules as appropriate
    - Probably under Build tab

7. Add Stupid Mekton Tricks
    - Dunno yet
